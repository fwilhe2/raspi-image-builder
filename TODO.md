- Finish firewalld setup
- Figure out how to only expose k8s API on the internal interface
- Don't run dnsmasq in a hostNetwork pod, use k8s services
- Use NMState for interface config
- Use Machine Config Operator to deploy needed files:
  - /etc/dbus-1/system.d/FirewallD.conf
  - /etc/zincati/config.d/55-updates-strategy.toml
  - If using MCO isn't feasible, maybe use an init container that mounts those locations as a hostPath and overwrites them? It could possibly use Ansible so it only touches the files when needed.
